# Cloud-9 Services


Welcome to Cloud-9. This is a pr0xy project (Using the Interstellar Pr0xy). These are the instructions to follow:

1. Open: `https://github.com/UseInterstellar/Interstellar`
2. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
3. Click `Code` (green button) and then `Create Codespace on main`.
4. In the terminal at the bottom, paste `pnpm i && pnpm start`.
5. Respond to the application popup by clicking `Make public`.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you click the `Make public` button, or the proxy won't function properly.
5. Access the deployed website from the ports tab.
6. For subsequent uses in the same codespace, just run `pnpm start`

> [!NOTE]
> After clicking on the port, make sure to open up this website: `https://settings101.github.io/cloud-9.html`
> and then cloak the given link (The cloaker works for anything too! Mostly GitHub pages, but it can't cloak YouTube and Google).
